I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), working on the **SAGEflex** project (Safeguarded AI Agents for Grid-Edge Flexibility), funded by ARIA. 

Previously, I completed my **PhD** at the **The University of Edinburgh** (2021--2025), supervised by Prof. Thomas Morstyn, Prof. Gareth Harrison, and Dr. Wei Sun. My thesis focused on "Unlocking Grid Flexibility of Distributed Energy Resources". I was also a Visiting PhD Student at Oxford from 2024 to 2025.

My research has focused on developing scalable and safe decision-making methods for power system operation, including probabilistic safety guarantees via chance constraints and robustness to distribution shifts, at the intersection of optimisation and AI. I am also interested in understanding the value of emerging resources (such as data centres) within power systems, as well as their broader policy and societal impacts, including effects on fuel poverty.
