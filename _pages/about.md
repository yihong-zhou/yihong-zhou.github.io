My research has focused on developing scalable and safe decision-making methods for power system operation, including probabilistic safety guarantees via chance constraints and robustness to distribution shifts, at the intersection of optimisation and AI. I am also interested in understanding the value of emerging resources (such as data centres) within power systems, as well as their broader policy and societal impacts, including effects on fuel poverty.
